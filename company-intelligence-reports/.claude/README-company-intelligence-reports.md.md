# Map — Company Intelligence Reports

**Live:** https://deep-dive-gen.vercel.app · **Stack:** Next.js 15 · React 19 · TypeScript

Deep Dive generates structured, board-ready "Company Deep Dive" reports for any public
company — full financial statements, narrative pulled straight from the company's SEC
filings, leadership org charts, and data visualizations.

The hard constraint behind every design decision: **completely free to run.**

> **No language model. No API keys. No per-use cost.**
> Every number, sentence, and chart traces to a free, keyless public data source.

Because nothing in the request path costs money, the app can stay online on a free tier
forever, and anyone can fork and deploy it without signing up for anything.

## How it's free

A normal "AI report generator" calls an LLM, which costs money and needs a key. Deep Dive
replaces the LLM with two ideas:

1. **Curated reports** — seven marquee companies (Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Alphabet, AWS,
   Anthropic, OpenAI) are hand-written deep dives, grounded in real SEC numbers and stored
   as Markdown in the repo. They render instantly with zero network calls.
2. **Live reports** — any other public company is assembled on demand from **free, keyless**
   public APIs (SEC EDGAR, Wikipedia, OpenAlex). No synthesis model — the narrative is the
   company's *own* words, lifted from its latest 10-K.

The only "AI-shaped" thing missing is original prose for arbitrary companies, which is
exactly the part that isn't free. Everything else — financials, risk factors, strategy,
competition, leadership, charts — is real public data, rendered well.

## System architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["Browser<br/>(search + stream reader)"]

    subgraph Vercel["Vercel — Next.js (free tier)"]
        P["page.tsx<br/>client UI"]
        R["/api/generate<br/>streaming route handler"]
        FS[("content/reports/*.md<br/>curated reports")]
    end

    U -->|"GET ?company=…"| R
    R -->|"text/plain stream"| U
    P --- U

    R -->|"curated"| FS
    R -->|"live"| SEC["SEC EDGAR"]
    R --> WIKI["Wikipedia REST"]
    R --> OA["OpenAlex"]

    classDef ext fill:#eef,stroke:#88a;
    class SEC,WIKI,OA ext;
```

- The frontend is a single client component that opens a streaming `fetch` and feeds chunks
  into `react-markdown`.
- The backend is one **streaming route handler** (`/api/generate`). It runs on Vercel's Node
  serverless runtime, calls only public APIs, and streams Markdown back in ~220-character
  chunks so the report renders progressively.
- Curated Markdown files are bundled into the serverless function via
  `outputFileTracingIncludes` so they're readable at runtime.

## Request lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant UI as page.tsx
    participant API as Generate route
    participant REG as registry
    participant GEN as buildLiveReport
    participant EXT as Public data APIs

    User->>UI: type "Tesla" → Generate
    UI->>API: GET /api/generate?company=Tesla
    API->>REG: findCurated("Tesla")

    alt curated company
        REG-->>API: CuratedMeta
        API->>API: read .md + inject leadership
    else live company
        REG-->>API: null
        API->>GEN: buildLiveReport("Tesla")
        GEN->>EXT: parallel fetches
        EXT-->>GEN: profile · financials · filings · wiki · research
        GEN-->>API: assembled Markdown (+ chart blocks)
    end

    API-->>UI: stream Markdown (chunked)
    loop each chunk
        UI->>UI: react-markdown re-render
    end
    UI-->>User: report with tables, charts, org chart
```

## The two report paths

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q["company query"] --> F{"findCurated()?"}
    F -->|"match"| C["read content/reports/slug.md"]
    C --> CL["inject Leadership section<br/>(org chart + table)"]
    CL --> S["stream"]
    F -->|"no match"| L["buildLiveReport()"]
    L --> S
    S --> RENDER["client renders"]
```

`findCurated()` normalizes the query (lowercase, strip punctuation) and matches it against
each curated company's slug, name, ticker, and aliases — so `AAPL`, `apple`, and
`Apple Inc.` all resolve to the curated Apple report, while `claude` → Anthropic and
`chatgpt` → OpenAI.

---

## Live report assembly pipeline

For a non-curated company, `buildLiveReport()` fans out to every free source in parallel,
then assembles a full report section by section.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q["company query"] --> RC["resolveCik()<br/>company_tickers.json"]
    RC --> PAR{{"parallel fetch"}}

    PAR --> PROF["submissions JSON<br/>profile + filing list"]
    PAR --> FIN["companyfacts JSON<br/>XBRL financials"]
    PAR --> WK["Wikipedia summary"]
    PAR --> OA["OpenAlex works"]

    PROF --> TENK["latest 10-K (HTML)"]
    PROF --> F4["recent Form 4 (XML)"]

    TENK --> NAR["Business · Competition<br/>Risk Factors · MD-A · employees"]
    F4 --> EXE["executive officers"]
    FIN --> CHARTS["line · bar · donut charts"]

    NAR --> MD["assemble Markdown report"]
    EXE --> MD
    CHARTS --> MD
    WK --> MD
    OA --> MD

    MD --> OUT["stream to client"]
```

The assembled report contains: Executive Summary · Company Overview · Strategic Direction
(10-K Business) · Business Model & Financials (tables **and** charts) · Competitive
Positioning (10-K Competition) · Key Risks (10-K risk factors) · Recent SEC Filings ·
Research Signals · Outlook (10-K MD&A) · **Leadership** (org chart) · Sources.

---

## Data sources

Every source below is **free and requires no API key**. SEC asks for a descriptive
`User-Agent`, which `lib/http.ts` sets on every request.

| Source | Endpoint | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| SEC ticker DB | `sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json` | name/ticker → CIK resolution |
| SEC submissions | `data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK…json` | HQ, industry, exchange, filing history |
| SEC company facts | `data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK…json` | multi-year XBRL financials |
| SEC archives | `sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/…` | 10-K (HTML), Form 4 (XML) |
| Wikipedia | `en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/…` | narrative company overview |
| OpenAlex | `api.openalex.org/works?…` | recent research output |
| ui-avatars | `ui-avatars.com/api/…` | executive initials avatars (client) |
| Favicons | Clearbit / DuckDuckGo / Google | company logos (client, with fallback) |

HTTP responses are cached at the edge via Next's `revalidate` (e.g. the 1 MB ticker file
for a day) to keep cold-start latency and request volume low.

## 10-K narrative extraction

The narrative sections are the company's own words, parsed from the most recent 10-K. This
is where most of the engineering lives, because 10-K HTML is large and inconsistent.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    H["10-K HTML"] --> T["htmlToText()<br/>strip tags · decode<br/>numeric entities"]
    T --> SL["sliceItems()<br/>longest text block<br/>per 'Item N'"]
    SL --> I1["Item 1<br/>Business"]
    SL --> I1A["Item 1A<br/>Risk Factors"]
    SL --> I7["Item 7<br/>MD-A"]
    I1 --> EXB["excerpt()<br/>+ markdown sanitize"]
    I1 --> CMP["Competition<br/>subsection"]
    I1A --> RH["riskHeadlines()<br/>short header lines"]
    I7 --> EXM["excerpt()"]
```

Key tricks:

- **`sliceItems()`** indexes every `Item N` marker and keeps the *longest* block per item —
  the real section, not the table-of-contents line that repeats the same headings.
- **`htmlToText()`** decodes numeric HTML entities (`&#8217;` → `'`) so smart quotes render
  correctly, and preserves block boundaries as newlines so headers stay on their own lines.
- **`excerpt()`** trims to a sentence boundary and **sanitizes Markdown** (escaping `*_` etc.,
  stripping `[]<>`) so raw filing text can never break the rendered report.
- **`riskHeadlines()`** heuristically pulls the short bold-style risk-category lines
  (e.g. Tesla's *"Risks Related to Our Operations"*).

---

## Executive extraction (Form 4)

Leadership for live companies comes from **SEC Form 4** filings (insider transactions),
whose raw XML carries each reporting owner's name and officer title — far more reliable
than parsing the 10-K's officer table.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    FL["filing list"] --> SEL["pick 10 recent Form 4"]
    SEL --> XML["fetch raw XML<br/>(strip xsl render prefix)"]
    XML --> P["parse rptOwnerName<br/>+ officerTitle<br/>+ isOfficer"]
    P --> N["reformat 'Last First' → 'First Last'<br/>(+ suffix, case fixes)"]
    N --> R["rank by seniority<br/>dedupe → top 6"]
    R --> ORG["leadership org chart + table"]
```

Names arrive as `Last First Middle [Suffix]` and are reordered, suffix-aware
(`Ford William Clay Jr` → `William Clay Ford Jr`), with title casing normalized
(`PRESIDENT &amp; CEO` → `President & CEO`). Curated companies use a hand-verified C-suite
instead.

---

## Financial data (XBRL)

`fetchFinancials()` reads the SEC's XBRL "company facts" and builds clean annual series.
Companies re-tag the same line item over time (e.g. `Revenues` →
`RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax`), so a single concept leaves gaps.
`mergedAnnual()` fills each fiscal year from the **highest-priority concept that reports
it**, yielding a continuous multi-year series for revenue, gross profit, operating income,
net income, R&D, assets, liabilities, equity, and buybacks. These power both the tables and
the charts.

---

## The chart system

Charts are **dependency-free** — hand-rolled SVG (line/bar/pie/donut) and HTML
(org-chart hierarchy). They travel *inside the Markdown* as fenced `chart` code blocks
carrying a JSON spec, and are intercepted at render time.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SRC["lib/generate.ts<br/>or curated .md"] -->|"chart block (JSON)"| MD["Markdown stream"]
    MD --> RM["react-markdown"]
    RM -->|"code.language-chart"| INT["MarkdownArticle<br/>interceptor"]
    INT -->|"JSON.parse"| CH["Chart component"]
    CH --> A["SVG line / bar / donut"]
    CH --> B["HTML org chart"]
    INT -->|"parse fails<br/>(still streaming)"| PH["'Rendering chart…'"]
```

This keeps charts in the same streaming pipeline as the rest of the report. While a chart
block is still streaming (incomplete JSON), the interceptor shows a placeholder instead of
raw text; once the closing fence arrives it parses and renders. Live reports auto-emit
revenue line, revenue-vs-net-income bar, margin-trend line, a revenue-allocation donut, and
a leadership org chart; curated reports add tailored charts (segment donuts, valuation bars,
investor splits).

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

No environment variables are required.

---

## Deployment

The app is a standard Next.js project and deploys to Vercel's free tier with **no
environment variables**:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel --prod --yes
```

Or push to GitHub and import at vercel.com/new. The result is a permanent public URL that
stays free because nothing in the request path costs money.

---

## Limitations

These all follow directly from the "no paid APIs" rule, and the UI is honest about them:

- **Private companies** (no SEC filings) get a lighter, Wikipedia-grounded profile.
- **LinkedIn links** are people-search URLs, not exact profile deep-links (no free API
  returns those).
- **Executive avatars** are generated initials, not photos (real headshots aren't freely
  licensed for arbitrary executives).
- **Live narrative** is the company's own 10-K text, not original analysis — that's the one
  thing an LLM would add, and the one thing that isn't free.
